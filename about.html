      <h2 class="section-title">Biography</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Cyber-Physical Systems (C2PS), Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi (2022–present), where my research focuses on real-time UAV monitoring using computer vision and remote identification data, SPDM-based zero-trust chip-to-chip authentication and secure communications, and asynchronous NOMA protocols for reliable, high-throughput wireless networks. I previously held a postdoctoral appointment at the same center (2020–2022), contributing to novel non-orthogonal access schemes and packet repair protocols. Earlier, I served as Assistant Professor at COMSATS University Islamabad (Wah, Pakistan, 2014–2021), where I taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses, supervised BS/MS/PhD theses, secured grants to establish laboratories, and led program accreditation under the Washington Accord; and as Junior Lecturer at Bahria University (Islamabad, 2007–2008), supporting laboratory instruction and establishment. Alongside my research, I continue to publish in leading venues, draft proposals, co-supervise students, and fulfill annual teaching responsibilities at Khalifa University.</p>
