      <h2 class="section-title">Biography</h2>
      <p>Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Center for Cyber‑Physical Systems (C2PS) at Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE. His work focuses on real‑time monitoring of commercial UAVs through computer vision and remote identification data, SPDM‑based zero‑trust chip‑to‑chip authentication and secure communications, and asynchronous non‑orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocols for high‑throughput wireless networks. He actively drafts research proposals, publishes in leading venues, and co‑supervises graduate and undergraduate students while fulfilling annual teaching duties.</p>
      <p>Prior to his current role, Dr. Ahmed completed a postdoctoral appointment at C2PS from 2020 to 2022, where he developed asynchronous NOMA protocols with offline packet repair and recovery and contributed to novel non‑orthogonal multiple access schemes. From 2014 to 2021 he served as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering at COMSATS University Islamabad (Wah), Pakistan. During this period he taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses, supervised final‑year projects and MS/PhD theses, and secured grants to establish research laboratories. Earlier, he worked as a Junior Lecturer at Bahria University (Islamabad) from 2007 to 2008, providing laboratory instruction and supporting lab establishment and maintenance.</p>
