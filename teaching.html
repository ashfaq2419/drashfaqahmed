      <h2 class="section-title">Teaching Experience</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">I have a rich teaching background spanning undergraduate and postgraduate programs. At present, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Khalifa University’s Center for Cyber-Physical Systems in Abu Dhabi, where, alongside my research, I maintain annual   teaching responsibilities and co-supervise graduate and undergraduate students.
<br>
Between 2014 and 2021, I served as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at COMSATS University Islamabad (Wah), Pakistan. There, I taught a range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, supervised final-year projects as well as MS/PhD theses, secured grants to establish new research laboratories, and led program accreditation efforts under the Washington Accord as convener of the accreditation committee.
<br>
Earlier in my career (2007–2008), I worked as a Junior Lecturer at Bahria University, Islamabad, where I delivered laboratory lectures across multiple programs and contributed to the establishment and maintenance of teaching laboratories.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I see teaching as a responsibility that goes beyond delivering lectures. My goal is to make learning clear, 
        engaging, and relevant by connecting abstract concepts with real-world examples and applications. Over the 
        years, I have learned that students respond best when courses are organized around well-defined objectives 
        and supported by interactive methods such as discussions, peer-to-peer learning, simulations, and 
        project-based work. These approaches not only help students grasp the material but also encourage them to 
        think critically and work collaboratively.
      </p>
    
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In the classroom, I use questions, diagrams, and multimedia to reinforce key ideas and keep students 
        actively involved. I also try to create an inclusive environment—for example, encouraging group work that 
        brings together students with different strengths so they can learn from each other. Beyond the classroom, 
        I have organized industrial visits, seminars, and workshops that give students a chance to see how theory 
        translates into practice and to build professional skills. As the founding counsellor of the IEEE student 
        branch at COMSATS University, I worked closely with students to develop such activities and foster a sense 
        of community.
      </p>
    
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I believe students should not only understand theoretical foundations but also gain the confidence to apply 
        them to real problems. I monitor their progress carefully, using both formative and summative assessments, 
        and provide extra support where needed. I also update my courses regularly, introducing new tools and 
        teaching approaches, to ensure that the learning experience remains current, practical, and outcome-focused.
