      <h2 class="section-title">Teaching Experience</h2>
      <p>Dr.&nbsp;Ahmed has a rich teaching background spanning undergraduate and postgraduate programmes.  He currently serves as a postdoctoral fellow at Khalifa University’s Center for Cyber‑Physical Systems in Abu&nbsp;Dhabi.  In addition to pursuing cutting‑edge research on UAV monitoring and chip‑to‑chip security, he maintains annual teaching responsibilities and co‑supervises graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
      <p>From 2020 to 2022 he completed a postdoctoral appointment at the same centre, where he proposed asynchronous non‑orthogonal multiple access schemes with offline packet repair and recovery and published novel reliability strategies in leading journals.  During this time he also contributed to teaching activities and student mentorship.</p>
      <p>Between 2014 and 2021 Dr.&nbsp;Ahmed was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering at COMSATS University Islamabad (Wah), Pakistan.  There he taught a variety of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, supervised final‑year projects and MS/PhD theses, secured grants to establish new research laboratories and led program accreditation efforts under the Washington Accord as convener of the accreditation committee.</p>
      <p>Earlier in his career (2007–2008) he served as a Junior Lecturer at Bahria University (Islamabad), where he delivered laboratory lectures for multiple programmes and supported the establishment and maintenance of teaching laboratories.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Dr.&nbsp;Ahmed views teaching as a vocation that demands empathy, creativity and continual learning.  Drawing on experience from both academia and industry, he strives to deliver lectures at a level that is accessible to all students and anchors abstract concepts in real‑world examples.  He divides each course into a series of learning objectives aligned with Bloom’s taxonomy and employs a variety of active‑learning techniques—group discussions, peer teaching, interactive simulations and project‑based assignments—to encourage critical thinking and collaborative problem solving.</p>
      <p>He regularly engages the class with brief questions, colour‑coded diagrams and multimedia presentations to reinforce key concepts.  Seating arrangements are deliberately mixed to ensure that strong and struggling students learn from each other, and he frequently organises industrial visits so that senior students can witness engineering principles in practice.  As the founding counsellor of the IEEE student branch at COMSATS University he helped organise seminars, workshops and competitions to build professional skills and foster a vibrant learning community.</p>
      <p>Dr.&nbsp;Ahmed believes that students should not only grasp theoretical material but also be able to apply it to solve practical problems.  To this end he closely monitors progress against defined learning objectives using formative and summative assessments and provides additional support where needed.  He continually updates his courses and adopts new technologies and pedagogical approaches to create an engaging, outcome‑based learning environment.</p>
